# memory-sqlite

Forward-only SQLite schema migrations for the shared-memory system. The package
is an inert persistence foundation: it does not open a production database,
implement `MemoryPort`, or enable any memory feature flag.

Call `migrate(database)` on an explicitly opened `node:sqlite` database. The
runner enables foreign-key enforcement, rejects unknown future versions and
checksum changes, and applies each migration in an exclusive transaction.

There are intentionally no down migrations. Recovery is by disabling durable
writes and restoring the verified pre-migration database snapshot, as required
by the approved migration plan.
